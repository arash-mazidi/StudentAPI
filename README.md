1. Save one student
2. Update one student
3. Display all students
4. Delete one student
5. Display one student

## How to Configure StudentAPI?

Additionally, ensure that you have MySQL Workbench installed on your system, and create a database named "student." Afterward, you can run the API using Eclipse or your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
